### Hi there 👋

        <td><p>Hello, World! 👋 I'm Tuddi, a Full-Stack Dev in Bucharest. I like learning, solving problems, and trying new tech. My main langs are Java and Python (& sometimes Golang). I'm also into Scala for big data. I'm optimizing Java code for high-throughput, low-latency financial software. If you're into speed, let's connect!</p></td>

        <td><p>Fun fact: <em>I can practically write anything in Java 🤓 (even without libraries, only if I have the time for that).</em> Recently, after diving into a few books on Java and its performance, I’ve significantly improved my code, making it easier to read and more efficient. My home research has touched on topics like JMH, Java memory management, JVM tuning flags, and virtual threads, allowing me to optimize the delivered code.</p></td>
