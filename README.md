### Hi there 👋

        <td align="center" valign="center"><p>Hello, World! 👋 I'm Tuddi, a highly driven Full-Stack Developer and lifelong learner 📚 based in Bucharest, Romania. I'm passionate about learning, problem-solving, and exploring new technologies. My main programming languages are Java (and its ecosystem) and Python, and I'm looking to dive deeper into Scala for big data processing. I enjoy technical discussions and contributing to impactful solutions, that's the reason why over the past years, I've worked on many projects, gaining both technical and soft skills. After a year-long break, I decided to pursue a master's at Politehnica University of Bucharest.</p></td>

        <td align="center" valign="center"><p>Fun fact: <em>I can practically write anything in Java 🤓 (sometimes without libraries).</em> Recently, after diving into a few books on Java and its performance, I’ve significantly improved my code—making it both easier to read and more efficient. My home research has touched on topics like JMH, Java memory management, JVM tuning flags, and virtual threads, allowing me to better optimize my work.</p></td>
